            <section>
                <p>
                    A "bubble" implies a disconnect between valuation and underlying technological reality. We argue that the current AI surge is justified because it represents a <strong>General-Purpose Technology (GPT)</strong>—an invention so fundamental it reshapes the entire economic landscape. To dismiss AI's ascent is to misunderstand the historical pattern of foundational innovation and the enormous, necessary capital expenditure driving it.

            <section>
                <p>
                    The current technology is a culmination of decades of research, not a sudden event. Comparing AI to previous GPTs reveals striking parallels:

                <h3 class="mt-4">Key Historical Inventions (GPTs):</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Mechanical Power:</strong> The Steam Engine led to trains, railroads, and the transformation of global transport and supply chains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrification:</strong> Created massive new sectors for utilities, industrial manufacturing, and residential infrastructure (electricians, appliance makers).</li>
                    <li><strong>Telecommunications:</strong> The Telephone and Radio/TV built vast communication networks and media empires.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digitalization:</strong> The Transistor and Personal Computer powered the chip boom, leading directly to the Internet and mobile revolution.</li>

                <p>
                    As a chess player, I remember IBM’s Deep Blue defeating World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. <a href="#ref1" class="citation"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This proves the concept of AI isn't new. Why the explosion now? The difference is <strong>scale, not concept</strong>. Deep Blue relied on brute force calculations using minimal memory (max 16 MB) and a single-core CPU.

            <section>
                <p>
                    The difference between 1997 and today is the industrial-scale infrastructure buildout. This capital spending forms a structural foundation that cannot simply vanish.

                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>GPU Power:</strong> Modern deep learning relies on immense, parallel processing power from companies like NVIDIA, allowing models with billions of parameters to be trained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adoption Speed:</strong> The Generative AI movement, exemplified by systems like ChatGPT, reached <strong>one million users in just five days</strong>—a pace of adoption far exceeding foundational technology phases like the Internet. <a href="#ref2" class="citation"><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>
                    <li><strong>New Platforms:</strong> Analogous to the 2007 smartphone, which launched multi-billion dollar industries (Uber, digital wallets), AI is the platform for the next wave of productivity tools and services.</li>

                    <li><strong>Market Projection:</strong> The global AI market size is projected to reach an astronomical <strong>$3.497 trillion by 2033</strong>, growing at a CAGR of 31.5% from 2025. <a href="#ref3" class="citation"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure Spending:</strong> Revenue for worldwide AI chips is set to surpass <strong>$92 billion</strong> this year, indicating massive, non-speculative capital deployment into the "picks and shovels" of the AI revolution.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">IV. The Bubble Myth vs. Healthy Market Correction</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Market volatility is inevitable and necessary, but the correction of speculative stocks should not be confused with the collapse of the underlying technology.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">The Distinction Between Foundation and Fantasy:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>The "Kitchen Towel" Effect:</strong> Yes, there is a bubble in minor players—companies whose only real asset is having "AI" in their name. These players are the "kitchen towel alternatives" bought in a panic, but their inevitable failure will be a return to value, not a sign of technological fraud.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Dot-Com Parallel (2000):</strong> When the Dot-Com Bubble burst, the NASDAQ index fell by nearly <strong>77%</strong>, wiping out countless unprofitable startups. <a href="#ref4" class="citation"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
                        <ul class="list-circle ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>The Survivors:</strong> Foundational companies like Microsoft, Apple, and a young Google survived and emerged stronger, having been purged of speculative competition.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Legacy:</strong> The crash left behind fiber-optic cables and server farms—the essential infrastructure that powered the next two decades of digital growth.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <p class="mt-4">
                    The correction is a mechanism that filters out the hype and reinforces the true leaders (NVIDIA, Google, OpenAI, Oracle) who are built on real investment and demonstrable utility.
