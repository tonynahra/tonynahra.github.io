            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">I. The AI Era: The Latest General-Purpose Technology (GPT)</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    A "bubble" suggests that current valuations are rooted in fantasy and detached from technological reality. We argue that the AI surge is fully justified because it represents a <strong>General-Purpose Technology (GPT)</strong>—an invention so fundamental it demands the restructuring of capital and reshapes the entire economic landscape. To dismiss AI's ascent is to misread the historical pattern of foundational innovation and overlook the necessary, enormous capital expenditure driving it.

            <section>
                <p>
                    The technology is a culmination of decades of research. Comparing AI to previous GPTs reveals striking parallels in how these inventions created entirely new economic ecosystems:
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">GPTs: Creating New Economic Ecosystems</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Steam Engine:</strong> Did not just power ships; it created the vast, integrated infrastructure of trains, railroads, and stations, enabling mass production and continental transport.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> Created the entire utility sector and enabled the vertical growth of cities (skyscrapers, elevators) and the night economy. Efficient manufacturing is impossible without it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Airplane:</strong> Led to the development of airports, air traffic control, catering services, travel agencies, and modern tourism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transistor and Internet:</strong> The transistor was the major leap that enabled the Personal Computer, which, combined with the Internet, launched multibillion-dollar industries like e-commerce and social networking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartphone and Apps:</strong> Solved complex problems and catalyzed new multi-billion dollar industries, such as ride-sharing (Uber) and mobile payments, demonstrating the platform effect of new technology.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mt-4">The Deep Blue Analogy and the Compute Gap:</h3>
                <p>
                    As a chess player, I remember IBM’s Deep Blue defeating World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. <a href="#ref1" class="citation"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This event proved AI's capability for focused, complex computation. However, Deep Blue was a proprietary IBM mainframe, a technological behemoth inaccessible to the public. To put the compute power of that era into perspective, a high-end consumer computer at the time typically ran with a single-core CPU and a maximum of 16 MB of RAM. It was <strong>that lack of accessible, distributed compute power</strong> that prevented the training of large, versatile AI models. The current explosion is fueled by the democratization of this power.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">III. The Engine of Change: Scale, Capital, and New Platforms</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    The difference between 1997 and today is the industrial-scale infrastructure buildout. This capital spending forms a structural, permanent foundation that cannot simply vanish.
                </p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">The Computational Breakthrough and Adoption:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>GPU and Data Centers:</strong> Modern deep learning relies on immense, parallel processing power from companies like NVIDIA. This requires billions in <strong>recurring capital expenditure</strong> to build and power new data centers—a permanent structural cost, not a fleeting investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adoption Speed:</strong> The Generative AI movement, exemplified by systems like ChatGPT, reached <strong>one million users in just five days</strong>—a pace of adoption far exceeding foundational technology phases like the Internet. This speed confirms profound market demand. <a href="#ref2" class="citation"><sup>[2]</sup></a></li>
                    <li><strong>The Smart Device Analogy:</strong> Whoever underestimated the smart phone in 2007, seeing only an expensive cellular phone, failed to foresee that it would open possibilities for new multibillion-dollar industries like Uber, digital wallets, and geolocation services. AI is that new platform now, ready to birth thousands of yet-unimagined applications.</li>

                    <li><strong>Market Projection:</strong> The global AI market size is projected to reach an astronomical <strong>$3.497 trillion by 2033</strong>, growing at a massive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 31.5% from 2025. <a href="#ref3" class="citation"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Investment:</strong> Revenue for worldwide AI chips is set to surpass <strong>$92 billion</strong> this year, a clear indicator of massive, non-speculative capital deployment into the "picks and shovels" that enable the entire AI revolution.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">IV. The Bubble Myth: Distinguishing Correction from Collapse</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Market volatility is inevitable and necessary, but the correction of speculative stocks should not be confused with the collapse of the underlying, foundational technology.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">The Purging of Speculative Capital:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li>
                        <strong>The "Kitchen Towel" Effect:</strong> We concede that there is a bubble in minor players. This is analogous to the COVID-19 panic buying where, once toilet paper sold out, people hysterically bought kitchen towels as an inferior, temporary substitute. In the stock market, these "kitchen towel alternatives"—companies <strong>falsely pretending to be in core AI businesses</strong>—are bought in a frenzy. When the market corrects, this speculative capital flows out, not because AI failed, but because investors returned to value.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Dot-Com Parallel (2000):</strong> When the Dot-Com Bubble burst, the NASDAQ index fell by nearly <strong>77%</strong>, wiping out countless unprofitable startups. <a href="#ref4" class="citation"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
                        <ul class="list-circle ml-6 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>The Survivors:</strong> Companies like Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, and Google survived and emerged stronger, largely because they had (or quickly established) strong fundamentals and revenue streams.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Infrastructure Legacy:</strong> Crucially, the crash left behind immense, undervalued physical assets—fiber-optic cables and server farms—the essential infrastructure that powered the next two decades of digital growth.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Healthy Correction:</strong> This necessary mechanism clears speculative capital, allowing investors to refocus on the true leaders (NVIDIA, Google, OpenAI, Oracle) who are built on real investment, strong cash flows, and demonstrable utility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    The current market leaders possess massive scale, deep moats, and strong financials, making them structurally different from most of the highly-leveraged, zero-revenue companies that defined the peak of the 2000 bubble.
