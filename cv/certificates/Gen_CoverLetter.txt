Hello,

Thank you for considering my application. My name is Tony Nahra, and I am an advanced full
stack developer with extensive experience in the healthcare field. My work has been deployed
on numerous websites, reaching millions of users globally.

In my current role within the UIowa Healthcare, I have focused on enhancing team efficiency
through automation. I successfully developed numerous Python scripts that automate the
generation of weekly tasks and reports. I would be happy to demonstrate this during an interview.

In my previous role, I designed and developed a proprietary database-driven Learning
Management System (LMS) tightly integrated with an interactive tutorial engine I also created.
This system was specifically built for healthcare and integrated seamlessly with CERNER
Millennium.

Beyond my general CV, I would like to highlight my strong database and data management
skills. I have created over 1000 complex SQL stored procedures, views, and web services to
deliver content effectively to customer portals. Furthermore, I developed user-friendly UI
interfaces for data visualization, usage charting, and the generation of periodic client reports. My
proficiency extends to data analysis and I have developed VBA add-ins for Excel. These add-ins
enabled the retrieval of SQL data and its transformation into OLAP pivot tables, facilitating
in-depth data analysis and reporting. I have used Tableau, Python and HTML5 UI libraries and I
included some samples in the documents section.

I also would like to add that I attended numerous internal training courses on Epic Reporting Workbench,
Clarity, SlicerDicer and more. I am Epic and Oracle certified.

Based on my experience and accomplishments, I am confident that I meet and exceed the
requirements for this position. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and present my
project portfolio in person. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Tony Nahra
