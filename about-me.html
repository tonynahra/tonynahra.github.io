        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Tony Nahra, a passionate Software Engineer and Data Professional with a deep love for solving complex problems through technology. 
            My journey in tech started over two decades ago, fueled by a curiosity for how things work—from the logic of code to the physics of the universe.
        </p>

        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            I believe that technology is most powerful when it bridges the gap between data and human understanding. 
            Whether I'm designing a database architecture, building an interactive tutorial engine, or analyzing financial trends, 
            my goal is always clarity, efficiency, and usability. I don't just write code; I build systems that empower users.
        </p>

        <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Over the years, I've had the privilege of working in diverse sectors, including healthcare and finance. 
            At the <strong>Patient Education Institute</strong>, I led the development of multimedia tutorial systems that have educated millions of patients worldwide. 
            My work involved not just coding, but architecting scalable solutions that could handle multilingual content, offline access via tablets, and seamless integration with hospital EMR systems like Cerner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to that, at the <strong>Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</strong>, I honed my skills in data analysis and financial modeling. 
            I developed tools to simulate investment strategies, back-test theories, and visualize complex financial data for analysts managing billions in assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Beyond the Screen</h3>
        <p>
            When I'm not at my computer, you can find me exploring the world of physics, particularly quantum mechanics and signal processing. 
            I have a keen interest in <strong>Fourier Transforms</strong> and how they apply to everything from sound engineering to stock market cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also an avid chess player and volunteer trainer. The strategic depth of chess mirrors the architectural thinking required in software engineering—anticipating moves, managing resources, and adapting to new patterns.
