    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="about-me-content">
        <p>Hello, I'm Tony. Welcome to my personal page. I'm a technology professional driven by a lifelong passion for solving complex problems. For me, programming, software, and mathematics were hobbies long before they became a career, which has allowed me to build a broad and deep set of technical skills over the years.</p>

        <p>My professional background spans over 25 years, with a primary focus on the <strong>healthcare and financial sectors</strong>. I specialize in database architecture, statistical analysis, and data warehousing. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of leading international technical teams in architecting and developing robust, full-stack systems. This work has included building everything from secure financial data-extraction tools to multilingual, SCORM-compliant learning platforms.</p>
        
        <p>I hold a <strong>Bachelor of Engineering</strong> degree and have gathered a wide range of certifications and senior-level experience. I am committed to building efficient, scalable systems and am always exploring new horizons in technology, from cloud infrastructure and AI to the fundamentals of signal processing.</p>
            
        <p>When I'm not coding or thinking about technology, my interests are quite diverse. I have a deep appreciation for finance, investment strategies, and the logic of chess. I also enjoy classical music, mathematics, and physics. I love spending time in nature and am incredibly proud that my passion for technology has passed on to my three children, all of whom are computer engineers.</p>
