    <h3 class="about-heading">My Background & Philosophy</h3>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>I'm a technology professional with a lifelong passion for solving complex problems. For me, programming, software, and mathematics were hobbies long before they became a career, which has allowed me to build a broad and deep set of technical skills.</p>
            
        <p>My professional background spans over 25 years, primarily focused on the <strong>healthcare and financial sectors</strong>. I specialize in database architecture, statistical analysis, and data warehousing. I've had the privilege of leading international technical teams in architecting and developing robust, full-stack systems, including multilingual, SCORM-compliant learning platforms and secure financial data-extraction tools.</p>
            
        <p>I am committed to building efficient, scalable systems and am always exploring new horizons in technology, from cloud infrastructure and AI to the fundamentals of signal processing.</p>
