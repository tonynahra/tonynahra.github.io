        <div class="card-item" style="border-left-color: #3498db;">
            <h3>Hello!</h3>
            <p>
                I'm Tony Nahra, a passionate Software Engineer and Data Professional with a deep love for solving complex problems through technology. 
                My journey in tech started over two decades ago, fueled by a curiosity for how things work—from the logic of code to the physics of the universe.

        <!-- Card 2: Philosophy -->
        <div class="card-item" style="border-left-color: #e74c3c;">
            <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that technology is most powerful when it bridges the gap between data and human understanding. 
                Whether I'm designing a database architecture, building an interactive tutorial engine, or analyzing financial trends, 
                my goal is always clarity, efficiency, and usability. I don't just write code; I build systems that empower users.

        <!-- Card 3: Professional Journey -->
        <div class="card-item" style="border-left-color: #f1c40f;">
            <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
            
            <h4>Current: Iowa Health Care</h4>
            <p>
                Currently, I serve as an <strong>Application Developer</strong> at <strong>Iowa Health Care</strong>. In this role, I focus on building robust applications that support critical healthcare operations. 
                My work involves full-stack development, integrating with complex medical data systems, and ensuring high availability and security for patient-centric tools.
            </p>

            <h4>Previous Experience</h4>
            <p>
                For over two decades at the <strong>Patient Education Institute</strong>, I led the development of multimedia tutorial systems deployed worldwide. 
                I architected solutions for multilingual content, offline tablet access, and seamless integration with EMR systems like Cerner.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                Prior to that, at the <strong>Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</strong>, I developed financial modeling tools to simulate investment strategies and visualize complex data for analysts managing billions in assets.
            </p>

        <!-- Card 4: Beyond the Screen -->
        <div class="card-item" style="border-left-color: #2ecc71;">
            <h3>Beyond the Screen</h3>
            <p>
                When I'm not at my computer, you can find me exploring the world of physics, particularly quantum mechanics and signal processing. 
                I have a keen interest in <strong>Fourier Transforms</strong> and how they apply to everything from sound engineering to stock market cycles.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                I am also an avid chess player and volunteer trainer. The strategic depth of chess mirrors the architectural thinking required in software engineering—anticipating moves, managing resources, and adapting to new patterns.
